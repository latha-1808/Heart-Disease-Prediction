# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction project using Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project leverages patient health metrics (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, age) for early heart disease detection, featuring performance evaluation and a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions.
