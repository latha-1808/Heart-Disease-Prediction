# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction project using Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project leverages patient health metrics (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, age) for early heart disease detection, featuring performance evaluation and a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions.
#Features :

Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN for heart disease prediction.

User-Friendly GUI: A Tkinter-based GUI for entering patient data and displaying results.

Performance Metrics: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Data Visualization: Graphs and metrics to help visualize model performance.

Real-Time Predictions: Allows healthcare professionals to input data and get instant results.
