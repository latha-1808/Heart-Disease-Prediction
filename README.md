# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction project using Machine Learning techniques, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The project leverages patient health metrics (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, age) for early heart disease detection, featuring performance evaluation and a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions.

**Features :**

**Machine Learning Models: **Implements Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN for heart disease prediction.

**User-Friendly GUI:** A Tkinter-based GUI for entering patient data and displaying results.
**
Performance Metrics:** Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

**Data Visualization:** Graphs and metrics to help visualize model performance.

**Real-Time Predictions: **Allows healthcare professionals to input data and get instant results.

**Installation

Prerequisites :**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package manager)

Usage

**Run the application:**

python app.py

Enter patient details in the GUI form (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, etc.).

Click the Predict button to get the result (e.g., "Likely to have heart disease" or "Unlikely to have heart disease").

**Technologies Used :
**
Programming Language: Python 3.7+

**Libraries:**

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Tkinter (for GUI)
